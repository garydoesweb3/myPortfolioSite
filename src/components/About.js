            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
            My love for computing began when I first heard the Apple Macintosh startup chime as a kid in the mid 90’s. And that love continued to evolve over time. From dying of cholera on the Oregon Trail, to trying to decipher the weird dial-up noise and even coding in music for my Myspace page. In 2002, when I went to college, Computer Science was calling my name. I had spent so much time with computers, how hard could it really be to get a CS degree? I dropped out after a couple years. Not because CS was that hard, my head and heart just weren’t into to the whole college experience. My next few years had me going through the whole “working in restaurants to travel a couple times a year” loop. I decided that it was time for me to leave the service industry. How could I get ahead of the curve? One word… Blockchain. I made a plan, had a lot to learn and picked up my keyboard again. This time going the self-taught blockchain developer route. I’ve learned so much and love that there is still so much to learn.  But cue Survivor’s “Eye Of The Tiger.” I’m Gary Mills, let’s build something together.
